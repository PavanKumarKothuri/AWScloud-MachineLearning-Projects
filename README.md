## **üöÄ Projects Overview**

### 1. üîí [**Password Strength Checker**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/password-strength-checker)  
- **Description:** A simple tool to evaluate password security based on entropy and character diversity.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit.  
- **Description:** Check the strength of entered passwords

### 2. [**üîç Basic Network Scanner**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/basic-network-scanner)
   - **Objective**: Develop a Python-based tool to scan open ports and identify vulnerabilities.  
   - **Technologies**: Python, Nmap  
   - **Description**: This simple network scanner checks for open ports and reports potential security issues in the network.

### 3. [**‚òÅÔ∏è S3 Bucket Permissions Checker**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/s3-permissions-checker)
   - **Objective**: Automate the process of checking S3 bucket permissions for misconfigurations.  
   - **Technologies**: Python, AWS SDK (Boto3)  
   - **Description**: This tool verifies S3 bucket permissions, ensuring that they are properly secured according to AWS best practices.  

### 4. [**‚òÅÔ∏è EC2 Web Application Deployment**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/AWS-ec2-webapp)  
- **Objective**: Learn to deploy and host a web application on an AWS EC2 instance using a basic web server.  
- **Technologies**: AWS EC2, Apache/Nginx, SSH, SCP  
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the deployment of a static web application by launching an EC2 instance, installing a web server, and hosting an HTML file. It covers essential cloud computing skills, including instance management, security group configuration, and file transfers. Cloud infrastructure!

### 5. [**‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless CRUD API with AWS Lambda**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/Serverless-CRUD-API-with-AWS-Lambda)  
- **Objective**: Build a fully serverless backend application with CRUD operations using AWS services.  
- **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Python, (Optional: DynamoDB)  
- **Description**: This project implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through a serverless architecture. 
Using AWS Lambda for computation and API Gateway for exposing RESTful endpoints, the application demonstrates how to design a scalable, 
cost-effective backend without managing servers. It includes robust input validation, error handling, 
and optional DynamoDB integration for persistent data storage. Ideal for modern web or mobile applications requiring 
lightweight and reliable backend solutions.  

### 6. [**‚òÅÔ∏è React App Deployment with S3 and CloudFront**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/React-AWS-S3-Cloudfront)  
- **Objective**: Deploy a React application on AWS S3 and distribute it globally using CloudFront for optimal performance and scalability.  
- **Technologies**: React, AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53 (optional), Python  
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the deployment of a static React web application to an S3 bucket, enabling static website hosting. The app is globally distributed via CloudFront to ensure low-latency access for users worldwide. Optional integration with Route 53 allows for custom domain and HTTPS setup. This guide covers end-to-end deployment, including build automation and infrastructure configuration, providing a cost-effective, scalable solution for hosting modern web applications.

### 7. [**‚òÅÔ∏è Simple File Backup System with AWS Lambda**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/FileBackup-AWS-S3-Lambda)  
- **Objective**: Automate file backup processes between S3 buckets using AWS Lambda and S3 Event Notifications.  
- **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Python (Boto3 SDK)  
- **Description**: This project automates the backup of files from a source S3 bucket to a destination bucket whenever a new file is uploaded. Using serverless architecture with Lambda and S3 Event Triggers, it eliminates the need for manual backups. The implementation covers key cloud skills, including event-driven architecture, IAM role configuration, and cost-effective automation. Perfect for businesses needing reliable, scalable, and hands-free data backup solutions.

## **üîÆ Future Plans**

This repository will be continually updated with new projects as I progress through the curriculum. I plan to expand my portfolio with more complex and advanced Cloud computing and Machine learning applications, demonstrating a broad range of skills.
