## **🚀 Projects Overview**

### 1. 🔒 [**Password Strength Checker**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/password-strength-checker)  
- **Description:** A simple tool to evaluate password security based on entropy and character diversity.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit.  
- **Description:** Check the strength of entered passwords

### 2. [**🔍 Basic Network Scanner**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/basic-network-scanner)
   - **Objective**: Develop a Python-based tool to scan open ports and identify vulnerabilities.  
   - **Technologies**: Python, Nmap  
   - **Description**: This simple network scanner checks for open ports and reports potential security issues in the network.

### 3. [**☁️ S3 Bucket Permissions Checker**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/s3-permissions-checker)
   - **Objective**: Automate the process of checking S3 bucket permissions for misconfigurations.  
   - **Technologies**: Python, AWS SDK (Boto3)  
   - **Description**: This tool verifies S3 bucket permissions, ensuring that they are properly secured according to AWS best practices.  

### 4. [**☁️ EC2 Web Application Deployment**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/AWS-ec2-webapp)  
- **Objective**: Learn to deploy and host a web application on an AWS EC2 instance using a basic web server.  
- **Technologies**: AWS EC2, Apache/Nginx, SSH, SCP  
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the deployment of a static web application by launching an EC2 instance, installing a web server, and hosting an HTML file. It covers essential cloud computing skills, including instance management, security group configuration, and file transfers. Cloud infrastructure!

### 5. [**☁️ Serverless CRUD API with AWS Lambda**](https://github.com/PavanKumarKothuri/Serverless-CRUD-API-with-AWS-Lambda)  
- **Objective**: Build a fully serverless backend application with CRUD operations using AWS services.  
- **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Python, (Optional: DynamoDB)  
- **Description**: This project implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through a serverless architecture. 
Using AWS Lambda for computation and API Gateway for exposing RESTful endpoints, the application demonstrates how to design a scalable, 
cost-effective backend without managing servers. It includes robust input validation, error handling, 
and optional DynamoDB integration for persistent data storage. Ideal for modern web or mobile applications requiring 
lightweight and reliable backend solutions.  

## **🔮 Future Plans**

This repository will be continually updated with new projects as I progress through the curriculum. I plan to expand my portfolio with more complex and advanced cloud computing, cybersecurity and machine learning applications, demonstrating a broad range of skills.
